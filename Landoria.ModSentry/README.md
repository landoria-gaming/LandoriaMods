# Landoria ModSentry

ModSentry verifies that the mods installed on each client match the mods expected
by the server. This lets every player use the same mods and play under the same
conditions.

## Features

- Checks that players have the required mods and only use approved files and versions.
- Rejects connections with extra, missing, or outdated mods and explains what needs fixing.
- Prevents players from reusing an old mod check response when connecting again. (Nonce-based server challenge.)

> **ModSentry verifies client mod files.** It does not detect cheats or injected code.
> A modified client can falsify its mod inventory.

## Installation

Most of Landoria mods need to be installed also on the dedicated server, we show you in this video how to do it on windows:

| Crossplay support | Steam network support |
|---|---
| Yes | No

| Client required | Dedicated server required | Player-hosted server |
|---|---|---|
| Yes | Yes | Not supported |

## Server configuration

Configure the client mod policy with these folders on the server:

| Folder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `BepInEx/config/ModSentry_Required` | Contains every mod and library DLL required on clients. Include `Landoria.ModSentry.dll` here. |
| `BepInEx/config/ModSentry_Optional` | Contains mods and library DLLs that clients may use but do not need. |

Copy the approved client DLLs into the appropriate folder. ModSentry compares
their plugin identifier, version, and SHA-256 hash with each connecting client.
Any client DLL listed in neither folder is rejected.

If a DLL contains several plugins, ModSentry checks each plugin's identifier and
version against the same approved DLL hash. Copy that DLL only once.

Server-only mods stay in `BepInEx/plugins` and are not copied into either policy
folder.
